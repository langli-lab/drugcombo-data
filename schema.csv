The TITE-CRM assumes a regression model for the probability of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) as a function of dose and allows information from all patients enrolled in the trial to be employed when allocating a new patient to a DL. Subjects were continuously recruited throughout the trial, without recruitment pauses. In this study, a priori DLT probabilities (“skeleton”) for the five doses are as follows, in dose order: 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.25, and 0.35. The power model (containing a single parameter 𝛽) was used to model the DLT rate of each dose. We placed a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.3 on the parameter 𝛽. To incorporate patients with partial follow-up for DLT, uniformly distributed DLT times were assumed. The MTD was defined as the highest dose with DLT probability of no more than 0.25. Furthermore, we have adopted a number of steps that limit escalation and obtain a safety profile. These steps include the following: (1) the dose assigned to each patient has an estimated DLT rate closest to, but not greater than, the target probability; (2) dose escalation is restricted to one level between adjacent patients; (3) escalation from the current dose is not allowed until at least one patient assigned to the current dose completes his or her follow-up; and (4) discontinue the trial when the probability of DLT at the lowest dose is larger than 25%.

25989270,NA,Escalation,3 + 3,"The study used a standard 3 þ 3 cohort design, with escalation of pimasertib dose from 45 mg per day in B33% increments until the MTD was reached. Dose escalation of pimasertib was based on the occurrence of defined dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during cycle 1 of therapy. The MTD was the dose immediately below the dose associated with more than one DLT. The MTD cohort was to be expanded to nine patients to gather more safety information at this dose level. Doselimiting toxicities were monitored centrally and the decision to escalate to the next dose level was taken by a safety monitoring committee."

If no DLT occurred at a certain level, dose escalation of S-1 was to proceed to the next level. Otherwise, when a DLT was seen in only one of the three patients, three additional patients were recruited at this dose level. If DLT was observed in two of the three patients or six patients, MTD was considered to be reached and referred to be the pre-dose level."

The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sorafenib was defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 in 6 patients experiences a DLT. That is, 3 patients were initially treated at a particular dose of sorafenib. If none of the 3 patients initially enrolled into this dose level cohort experiences DLT during treatment, 3 additional patients were entered at the next dose level. No intra-patient dose escalation was permitted. If one patient experienced DLT, then 3 additional patients were entered at that dose level. If more than one patient experienced DLT accrual stopped and the dose level immediately below the current dose was considered as the MTD and was the recommended dose for phase II studies. At the MTD of sorafenib, we expanded the cohort to include 5 more patients to further evaluate toxicity profile and efficacy."
